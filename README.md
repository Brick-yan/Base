# Base
Base Chain is a Layer 2 blockchain developed by Coinbase, which aims to provide faster and lower-cost transactions for the Ethereum ecosystem. It uses Optimistic Rollup technology to transfer a large amount of transaction data from the Ethereum mainnet to the Base Chain for processing, and then submit the final result back to the Ethereum mainnet.
